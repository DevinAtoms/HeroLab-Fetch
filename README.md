## This is a forked version of [hlo-api-client](https://github.com/mdreier/hlo-api-client) created by [mdreier](https://github.com/mdreier) on GitHub.

### Currently this is a WIP attempt to convert this into something usable in React Hooks, mostly with [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) in Next.js apps.

### I'd recommend using the original [hlo-api-client](https://github.com/mdreier/hlo-api-client) as it's generally a more complete package and the original creator is a better developer than I am.
